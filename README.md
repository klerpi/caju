# Personal Resume

This a Vue project I made so I could easily write my resume using web technologies. A web page allows me to get better font rendering, a finer control of the design and a better separation of concerns.

While it may be my resume, you can easily change it to fit your needs.

## Project Setup

You need to make sure you have NodeJS and NPM in your computer. Then, simply run `npm install` inside the project root to install the depedencies.
